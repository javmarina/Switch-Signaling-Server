# Signaling server for Nintendo-Switch-Remote-Control

[Cloud hosted on opeNode.io](https://www.openode.io/)

This repository contains the signaling server implementation for my [Switch remote play](https://github.com/javmarina/Nintendo-Switch-Remote-Control) project.

If you want to run the Nintendo-Switch-Remote-Control project as provided, you don't need this code. Otherwise, if you want to deploy your own server, you are in the right place.

It uses the [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) library for communication with the WebRTC peers.

What is a signaling server? See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling#the_signaling_server).
